# 🧠 Elite Enemies

---

## 💀 Mod Overview
Introduce a brand-new **Elite Enemy System** to *Escape from Duckov*!  
Normal enemies now have a chance to spawn as elite variants with unique **affixes** and exclusive loot.  
Elite enemies come with special behaviors, customized stats, visual effects, and prefix titles, making combat more dynamic and exciting!

All elite affixes are carefully designed and balanced to ensure the experience remains faithful to the original game while adding more unexpected encounters.

## 🧩 Known Issues
* ⚠️ Conflict with [Display Name](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3591373133), causing affix display issues  
  Recommended alternatives: use [Numerical Stats](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3590948345) or enable the built-in display system

  HarmonyLib → ModSetting → EliteEnemies
