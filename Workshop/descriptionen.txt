[list]
[*]Default affix cap is 2; boss elite chance is 0; any affix or elite probability/limit can be adjusted in settings
[*][b]Sticky[/b] is disabled by default; enable manually if desired
[*]Default balance based on [b]Survival Difficulty[/b]; for [b]new saves[/b], recommend lowering elite probability
[*]Supports [b]Chinese-English[/b] localization; other languages can follow sample files to create translation packs
[*]Latest version applies drop penalties to [b]Scav[/b] enemies; drop rate and quality lower than other enemies under same settings
[*]On low-spec PCs or with many mods, [b]wait 2–5s on map entry[/b] to stabilize FPS before starting; avoids unpredictable AI issues (e.g., with teleport mods)
[*]Description page space is limited; some sections were removed to avoid automatic moderation; see changelog for full updates
