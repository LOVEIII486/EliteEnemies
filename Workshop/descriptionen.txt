[h2]💀 Mod Introduction[/h2]
Adds an all-new [b]Elite Enemy System[/b] to “Escape from Duckov”!

<h2>💡 Notes</h2>
[list]
[*]Default affix limit is 2, boss elite chance is 0; both can be adjusted in settings
[*][b]Sticky[/b] is disabled by default and must be enabled manually
[*]Default balance is tuned for [b]Survival Difficulty[/b]; new saves may want to lower elite chances
[*]Supports [b]Chinese & English[/b] localization; other languages can be added using the sample files
[*]Latest version applies drop-rate penalties to [b]Scav[/b] enemies—loot quantity and quality will be lower under the same settings
[*]On low-end PCs or with many mods installed, [b]wait 2–5 seconds[/b] after entering a map before moving to ensure AI initializes correctly (especially if using teleport mods)
[*]Due to Steam’s auto-moderation limits, some sections were removed; check the change log for full update details
